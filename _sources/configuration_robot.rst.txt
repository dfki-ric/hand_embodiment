Configuration for a New Robotic Hand
====================================

Each target hand needs a configuration. These are typically stored in
``hand_embodiment.target_configurations``, but you can define them in your
own python script or module.

A configuration includes information about the kinematic setup of the hand:

* name of finger tip frames
* joints per finger
* base frame of the hand
* pose of base frame with respect to MANO base frame
* path to URDF
* virtual joints (e. g. coupling of joints)

The following scripts can be used to investigate a hand configuration:

* ``bin/kinematics_diagram.py`` - generates a kinematic diagram (graph) of the
  hand
* ``bin/vis_extended_hand_model.py`` - visualizes finger tip positions in the
  visual model of the hand, if you have to define additional finger tips this
  is a good tool to verify the result
* ``bin/gui_robot_embodiment.py`` - with this tool you can (1) find an
  appropriate pose of the hand in MANO's base and (2) interactively verify
  that the embodiment mapping finds appropriate solutions to mimic the MANO
  model
