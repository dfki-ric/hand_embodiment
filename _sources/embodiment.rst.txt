In order to convert a motion capture file to a trajectory that can be
executed by a robotic hand, you have to run the script
``bin/convert_hand_trajectory.py``. All scripts can be executed with the
option ``-h`` to see available options.

The script produces CSV files. You can visualize resulting trajectories
with ``bin/vis_embodied_trajectories.py``. Here are two examples of
visualizations created with this script:
